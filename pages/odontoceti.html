      <p>Odontocetes are built of about 72 known species in 6 families. They are known as <b>toothed whales</b> because unlike Mysticeti, they have teeth. Most of them anyway. The Ziphiidae family are known for their <b>beaks</b>.</p>

      <p>The Odontoceti order includes more than just whales. It includes dolphins, whales, and porpoises. One of the most common Odontoceti is the bottlenose dolphin. </p>

      <p>Sexual dimorphism is prevalent in Odontocetes. Females can be much larger than males of the same species, and males can be much larger than the females. One example of this is the Sperm whale, where males have been recorded up to 52 feet in length and weighing about 45 tons with females recorded up to 36 feet in length, weighing about 15 tons.</p>

      <p>Extant Odontoceti catch individual prey. Anything from fish, squid, and small crustaceans to other marine mammals. Killer whales have been known to hunt sperm whales in groups. All investigated species have been identified as having an echolocation ability to aid them in their hunt.</p>

      <p>Toothed whales share many common traits. Some of these traits include:
        <ul>
          <li>A fatty lump of tissue on the head called a melon, believed to aid in echolocation</li>
          <li>An asymmetric skull, also believed to accommodate echolocation</li>
          <li>Teeth, a beak, or both</li>
          <li>Single blowhole</li>
          <li>A complex system of nasal sacs</li>
        </ul>
