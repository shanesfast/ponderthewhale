      <p><strong>Taxonomy is a widely accepted orginizational system used to classify living things. We use this system to gain a better understanding about different forms of life and how they relate to one another.</strong></p>

      <p>The Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeaus made 2 huge contributions to this system in the mid 1700's when he began publishing his famous pamphlets <i>Systema Naturae</i>. The first contribution was his development of a hierarchical classifcation system. The second was his binomial nomenclature, a 2-part naming system.</p>

      <p> You have most likely heard this practice being used at some time in your life. Specific names for living organisms are often referred to as their <i>scientific name</i>. These words, such as "<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>"; the scientific name for a Beluga whale, are based on Latin and Greek roots and are often hard to pronounce. It's still fun to try.
      </p>

      <p>There is a structure which underlies the idea of Taxonomy. The path you will most commonly see is this:</p>

      <p>There are (of course) many arguments about what should go where and why, so this filing system is not set in stone. It is alive and moving, just like us!</p>
